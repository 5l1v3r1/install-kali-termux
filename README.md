# install-kali-termux
### Custom Kali installation based on the minimal file-system of the official nethunter repositories from Offensive Security, in termux without the need of having your device rooted. 
### More functions were added than in the script provided by offensive security and I will add more when the time comes.

#### Open termux and paste this code to install kali on it:
```bash
pkg install wget -y && wget -O install_kali https://git.io/JUnAD && chmod +x install_kali && ./install_kali
```
